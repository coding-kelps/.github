# Coding Kelps
Welcome to Coding Kelps!  
We're a group of coding enthusiasts who love to work on side projects and experiment with all sorts of cool tech.  

We're not your typical corporate organization - we're a laid-back crew who love to code, share ideas, and have fun. We believe that coding is an art form and we're always looking for new ways to express ourselves through our projects.  

Our team might be small, but we're mighty when it comes to coding skills. We're all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible and building things that blow people's minds. And, of course, we're all about that open-source life.
